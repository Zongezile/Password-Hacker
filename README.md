# Password-Hacker
I check the administrator login using the list of most popular administrator logins. 
I guess the password letter by letter by checking the connection time to a server using the socket module. 
Exceptions - entering the correct first letters of the password have a slightly longer connection time. 
It prints out the correct login and password in JSON format.
